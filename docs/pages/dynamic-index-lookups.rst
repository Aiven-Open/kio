Dynamic index lookups
=====================

For many applications it is useful to be able to dynamically load schema
entities. For instance, if building an application that inspects the traffic
between a consumer or producer and a broker, we would like the ability to parse
arbitrary requests and responses sent between the two.

The Apache KafkaÂ® Protocol has *lots of entities*, and while loading them all at
import time is definitely sometimes an option, as this is a fairly slow process,
it is not suitable for all applications.

The kio library provides the following APIs for applications where it's instead
deemed preferable to dynamically load schema entities.
