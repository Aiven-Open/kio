# Welcome contributor ðŸ‘‹

Contributions of all sorts are welcome, whether it's raising an idea for improvements,
reporting a bug, helping in reviewing open pull requests, or generally raising an issue.

When contributing please keep this in mind:

- Use issues to report bugs.
- Use discussions to raise ideas and propose features.
- Write code consistent with the project style and make sure tests and static type
  checks are passing, and that 100% test coverage is maintained.

The [README][readme] contains instructions for getting started with development.

We use [squash merging] to achieve a linear git history. This means every PR needs to be
a logic unit of changes to the code-base, that makes sense to be squashed. This also
allows for pushing many "fix" commits to feature branches without using force push.
